These include the digging-stick for cultivating steep hillside fields and small terraces, the adze-hoe, the stone-headed clod crusher, and the rawhide-lashed threshing pole. Although crop rotation has been practiced by the Aymara since time immemorial, some soils, particularly those of the pampas, are so poor that they must be allowed to lie fallow for 10 years between plantings.

Thongas, as well as most of the South African Natives, are essentially agriculturists, and they succeed in obtaining their food in abundance from the soil, although it is not very rich. The variety of their cereals is indeed remarkable, but they have never developed their cultivation to any great extent, because they did not wish to harvest more than was necessary for their immediate needs: there would have been no market for a surplus. Moreover they have never invented the plough, or thought of the use of irrigation, or of manure, those three great means of intensive production which civilised people have so long possessed. ...

The Kapauku of the Kamu-Valley cultivate two basically different type of terrain and zones of vegetation: the steep mountain slopes with the mountainous lofty Debei Valley, and the low-lying flat floor of the swampy Kamu Valley. The mountainous type of terrain has relatively poor, yelowish soil and is covered mostly with secondary forest; the flat Kamu Valley floor is composed of deep, rich, black alluvial soil, covered with grasslands and occasional shrubs and trees. The Papuans utilize both envirements by different methods of cultivation. The mountain slopes are cultivated by what I called the extensive shifting method which consists of clearing vegetation by cutting and burning, without any attempt at improving the soil by fertilization, draining, or spading. Such land is used almost exclusively for cultivation of sweet potatoes, planted by means of a dibble stick. After the harvest of one crop of tubers the area is allowed to become fallow and is recultivated only after a period ranging usually from eight to twelve years. This type of shifting cultivation shows an important additional characteristic which we labeled ""extensive"". The emphasis here is on the size of the cultivated area rather than on the skill and care devoted to the plants and soil. Accordingly, although the total yields from this area, due to its large size of 140,170 square meters (81 per cent of the total cultivated land), were approximately 113,700 kilogramms,the yield per square meter was only about one half of the yield of the gardens cultivated with intensive methods.

pospisil1963a [126]: [Val. 1,2] The discussion above has dealt with the three different kinds of cultivation employed by the Kapauku: the extensive shifting culivation on the mountain slopes, the intensive shifting cultivation of the floor of the Kamu-Valley, and the intensive complex cultivation on the valley floor. We have outlined the merits and liabilities of the three methods and pointed out that a healthy balance among the three seems to be the most desirable form of farming policy in the region of the Kamu Valley.

pospisil1958 [14]: [Val. 3] In this environment of rich soil, luxurious vegetation, but paucity of animals, the Kapauku live by horticulture. With their neolithic polished stone axes, they clear patches of secondary growth forests and build fences around areas in order to protect the growing crops from wild, as well as domesticated, pigs. The newly cleared land is burned over and on the following day a variety of crops is planted by means of a planting stick. The Kapauku raise sweet potatoes, sugar cane, several species of greens which resemble spinach, bananas, taro, gourds, cucumber, and three different species of reeds, the young shoots and buts of which are eaten. Recently introduced tobacco and manioc are grown as well. The domesticated pigs form the important source of proteins in the native diet. Apart from supplying food, pig breeding constitutes the only way to become rich and to acquire prestige, achievements which in turn enable a man to become an influential politician.

mair1934 [111/112]: The first step in every agricultural process is the clearing of the ground. This is done by cutting the grass down with a knife, or if it is not too long, hacking it off short with a hoe. The grass is burnt sometimes where it lies and sometimes in a heap at the side of the patch; the stubble is then broken up with a hoe, the roots thrown out, and the clods of earth loosened by hand. The old-fashioned hoe, which is still sometimes seen in use, consisted of a stick naturally bent at an acute angle, to the short arm of which was tied a heartshaped blade.

Although the Yanomamö spend almost as much time hunting as they do gardening, the bulk of their diet comes from foods that are cultivated. Perhaps 85 percent or more of the diet consists of domesticated rather than wild foods - plantains are by far the most important food in the diet.

chagnon1977 [35]: Each man's garden contains three or four varieties of both plantains and bananas. The larger portion of the cultivated land will contain plantains, as they produce a higher yield than bananas. The garden will also have a sizeable patch of seet manioc, a root crop that is boiled or refined into a rough flour by grinding it on a rock and then converting the flour into thick, round cakes of baked cassava bread. Many of the Yanomamö villages have recently obtained bitter manioc, a poisonous variety that must be leached of its toxic ingredient before it can be eaten.

On the other hand vegetation near the older Wolof villages is as thoroughly cleared as among the Mandinka. While Mandinka and Jola plant their groundnuts on ridges, the Wolof plant on the flat. They begin to clear their farms early in the year, taking advantages of the first heavy rain for extensive and rapid planting. For sowing groundnuts they have adopted from the Serahuli or Mandinka an adze-shaped tool (kcnko) which is held in one hand and used to make a series of holes in the ground, the seed being dropped in with the other hand. The earth is pressed down over the holes with the feet as the sower moves along.

Around the lake they cut and dry the seed-stalks of a kind of flag (Typha) which has a head something like a teasel, thresh out the seed and make flour of it; also wild rye and wild sunflower seed. They eat grass-nuts (Cyperus) and the seeds of the same, a plant with a triangular stalk.
gayton1948a [6]: Nothing could be more misleading than labeling the people of the San Joaquin Valley, whether the Yokuts lake tribes, the tribes of the foothills, or the Monachi of the mountains, ""seed-gatherers"" or ""seed-eaters,"" as though their diet were preponderantly vegetarian.
(...) Acorns and seeds are not to be discounted as less important than meat, but they were not more important in daily diet.

The tule provided essential materials for house construction and for the making of balsas which were essential for the exploitation of many of the lake resources and were used extensively in transportation as far away as the east side of the San Joaquin Valley. Tule roots and seeds provided a major part of the vegetable food, and the Tular harbored small animals and the tule elk.
